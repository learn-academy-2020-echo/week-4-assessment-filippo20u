# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. Are Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer:

  Ruby methods are accessors because they don't change a variable after a method is run on it.

  Researched answer:

  For most part, Ruby methods are acessors, it means that they don't mutate the object they are called on.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer:

  it's a chunk of code that delimited by do/end or braces

  Researched answer:

  Ruby code blocks are are delimited by do/end or curly braces, they can be anonomous or associated with method invocation.
  Ruby lets you group code into a standalone unit thay you can use as method argument.


3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer:

  it means that a method in Ruby doesn't require a "return" written in the code to give a return, it will give it anyway.

  Researched answer:

  Ruby has an implicit return, which means the value of the last line of a method is automatically returned without using the keyword return.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer:

  Ruby is an exmaple of object-oriented programing, it is a way to write code where everything is an object, an object is a contwianer of data (variables) and behaviour (method). the advantage of OOP is that my code is packed in objects so it's easier to debug. manipulate and change.

  Researched answer:

  OPP Object-oriented programming is a programming language that designes software organizing it in objects rather than functions and logic. an object contains data and behaviour.
  OOP is different than functional programming because the developer is focused on objects that you want to develop versus the logic required to manipulate them. OOP makes the code more scalable, reusable and easier to split projects into groups.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer:

  class are a blueprint for an object or object are instances of a class with their key:value pairs.

  Researched answer:

  Ruby has a deffirent definition of object and class compared to javascript, An object is a unit of data. A class is what kind of data it is.
  object: That's just any piece of data. Like the number 3 or the string 'hello'.
  class: Ruby separates everything into classes. Like integers, floats and strings.

6. STRETCH: What is Duck Typing?

  Your answer:

  (not sure how I put this in my mind)
  duck typying is a way to say that code should be typed describing the funzion and behabiour you are trying to achieve.
  "If it walks like a duck and it quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"

  Researched answer:

  it's a type of  programming typing where  any object may be used in any context, up until it is used in a way that it does not support and it will not work, so in the case of a duck, i don't need to define the object "Duck" but defining the methods "walk" and "quack" is enough.
